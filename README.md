In SV_US_L.py, I showcase a project in which I built a machine learning model using scikit-learn in Python to predict the likelihood of an athlete successfully landing a trick based on their features. Before training and testing the model, I performed data visualization to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset. The data was fictional but self-developed, using realistic values to illustrate a potential machine learning use case in the field of sports.

In AP7_dataanalysis, I present a typical data analysis script based on data generated during my VR projects. While this script was initially written for private use, it could be further modularized by defining global functions that can be reused whenever needed. All such functions could then be consolidated into a single script or module, allowing for more efficient and reusable analysis workflows in the future. The current script mainly focuses on data curation and preparation for statistical analysis, which is often carried out using tools like R or SPSS.

The statistical analyses are often conducted in R (as shown in the file nparLD_f2.ld.f1.R), which contains an example of a simple non-parametric ANOVA with one within-subject factor and two between-subject factors. Although this specific analysis was used less frequently in the results sections of my publications, it demonstrates the necessary steps following thorough data curation

The last project, DataCollection, illustrates how I typically calculated variables within the gaming scenarios of a Unity scene. These variables are often related to numerous events triggered by participants during our studies. Since I also worked with standalone devices, the data were saved to the internal storage of the head-mounted display (HMD) and could be extracted later for further analysis. Some of the recorded data correspond to specific time points, while others reflect continuous recordings throughout the experiment.
