# my-work-samples

In SV_US_L.py, I showcase a project in which I built a machine learning model using scikit-learn in Python to predict the likelihood of an athlete successfully landing a trick based on their individual features. Prior to training and testing the model, I performed data visualization to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset. The data was fictional but self-developed, using realistic values to illustrate a potential machine learning use case in the field of sports.
